Start by setting up an account at https://quartopub.com/.\n\nOnce you are set up with an account, you can publish your slides by going to the terminal and running:\nquarto publish quarto-pub slides.qmd\nIf you are not in the sub-directory containing your slides, you will either need to navigate there then run the above command or provide the path to your slides.qmd.\nYour slides will open in a browser. In the menu on the right side, change the slug to be the exact wording of the topic of the day (i.e. summarizing-numerical-data).\nAt this point, you’re all set! You can click the link at the top to see how your slides will look once they’re linking off of the course website.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about publishing with Quarto Pub, see the official documentation."
