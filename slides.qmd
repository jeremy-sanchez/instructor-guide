## Modifying your own slides

1. Be sure your personal fork of the `course-materials` is up to take by syncing it to the one on `github.com/stat20`.

2. Pull the most recent changes from your fork to your local machine.

3. Make changes to `slides.qmd` and save.

## Publishing your own slides

Quarto Pub is a free service for publishing quarto documents, including slides, online. Start by setting up an account at <https://quartopub.com/>.

1. Once you are set up with an account, you can publish your slides by going to the terminal and running:

   ```bash
   quarto publish quarto-pub slides.qmd
   ```
   
   If you are not in the sub-directory containing your slides, you will either need to navigate there then run the above command or provide the path to your `slides.qmd`.
   
2. Your slides will open in a browser. In the menu on the right side, change the slug to be the exact wording of the topic of the day (i.e. `summarizing-numerical-data`).

3. At this point, you're all set! You can click the link at the top to see how your slides will look once they're linking off of the course website.
